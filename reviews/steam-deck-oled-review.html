                <p>The OLED display is hands-down the most significant improvement in the Steam Deck OLED. User reviews consistently praise this upgrade:</p>
                
                <blockquote class="user-review">
                    "The OLED screen absolutely pops out in your face. It's truly eye-catching and makes games look incredible compared to the original LCD model." - Amazon Verified Purchase
                </blockquote>

                <p><strong>Key Display Features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> (vs 60Hz on LCD) - Smoother gameplay and reduced input lag</li>
                    <li><strong>HDR support</strong> with 1,000 nits peak brightness for stunning contrast</li>
                    <li><strong>True blacks and vibrant colors</strong> - Users report a "night and day" difference</li>

                    <li><strong>40fps gaming looks smoother</strong> at 80Hz refresh rate</li>
                </ul>

                <p>According to user feedback from Birchtree's review: <em>"This new OLED screen is not just good compared to the original Steam Deck, it's spectacular compared to any screen in this class."</em></p>

                <h2>Performance: Solid But Not Groundbreaking</h2>

                <p>The Steam Deck OLED maintains the same custom AMD APU as the original, with some efficiency improvements. Here's what real users are saying about performance:</p>

                <blockquote class="user-review">
                    "I'm currently playing Diablo 4 on my Steam Deck with high settings & 60 fps. It's flawless performance. Everything I've played on my SD performs perfectly." - Steam Community User
                </blockquote>

                <p><strong>Performance Highlights:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Same CPU/GPU performance</strong> as original Steam Deck</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved RAM speed</strong> - 6,400 MT/s (77% faster than LCD model)</li>
                    <li><strong>Better thermal management</strong> - Runs cooler and quieter</li>
                    <li><strong>Excellent for indies and older AAA games</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Struggles with latest demanding titles</strong> at high settings</li>
                </ul>

                <p>TechRadar's review notes: <em>"Things are a little different in 2024, as the Steam Deck OLED now struggles to maintain decent frame rates in major games."</em> This aligns with the 15W TDP limitation - it's powerful for a portable device but shouldn't be compared to desktop gaming.</p>

                    <li><strong>OLED efficiency gains</strong> - Display draws less power</li>
                    <li><strong>3-4 hours of intensive gaming</strong> vs 2-3 hours on LCD model</li>
